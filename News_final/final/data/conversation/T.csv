12/6/19,"How quickly people forget the day T closed up 50-cents while the general market tanked. This is a DEFENSIVE stock. Today's volume was significantly below average, indicating lack of buying interest from the algorithms. Lots of good economic news today means more money flowing into recently beat-up sectors like retailers & energy. T is up 25% over the last 12 months & has outperformed the S&P by 8%. Next week will be the last solid trading week of the year before heading into erratic lower-volume pre-holiday trading activity. Don't expect too much from T here, a slide back down to $36-$37 area quite possible. Even at that, still an EXCELLENT buying opp for those wanting to add some extra shares. Over the intermediate term (3-5 yrs), T is a STEAL below $40, we assimilate more whenever possible.",1,Projection?
